# MMP9_Enzyme_Bioinformatics_Studies
Determined the Reliability Index (RI) for point mutations at position 329 of the MMP9 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9) enzyme, using 'C' (Cysteine) as the wild-type reference under constant pH and temperature conditions.

Predicted the pathogenicity of selected mutations using the PredictSNP tool.

Screened 13 drug-like compounds (from an initial pool of 50) based on pkCSM factors, gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, and overall ADMET properties using SwissADME and pkCSM.

Performed molecular docking using BIOVIA Discovery Studio to evaluate ligand binding affinity, and generated both 2D and 3D structural visualizations.
