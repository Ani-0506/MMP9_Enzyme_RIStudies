# MMP9_Enzyme_Bioinformatics_Studies
Determined the Reliability Index (RI) for point mutations at position 329 of the MMP9 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9) enzyme, using 'C' (Cysteine) as the wild-type reference, under constant pH and temperature conditions.
Conducted Drug-likeness testing with 13 compounds screened from an original 50 by checking each of their pkCSM factors and ADMET properties
Performed docking using BIOVIA studios to get the 2D and 3D model
